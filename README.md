# FizzBuzzTest
"The "Fizz-Buzz test" is an interview question designed to help filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates who can't seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag."

- Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
- For multiples of three print “Fizz” and for multiples of five print “Buzz”.
- For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.
- Otherwise, simply print the number.
